# Bank Account Churning:
* Get bonuses for openining new checking/savings accounts
* Must have minimum balance
* Deposit a certain amount
* Chase Checking/Savings Account
* Citi Bank
* Capital One 360
* PNC Bank

# RE TIPS
* Dont try to time the market
* The source of the deal doesn't matter (on MLS vs off MLS)
* Hire a good real estate agent
* Get pre-qualified before buying a house
* Vacancy is about 8-10% because 8% of 365 days is almost 1 month. A 4% vacancy means you can find a new tenant in 2 weeks.
* Leasing fee is charged when managment company finds a new tenant. Usually 50% of first months rent.
* A class property: Appreciation
* B class property: Both
* C class property: Cash Flow
* Look for around ~12% cash on cash ROI and $200 cashflow for SFH
* Leverage is (Debt Owed / Value of Real Estate)
    * Good leverage is 65-70%
    * So if you have a $300,000 house, your debt on that house would be $195,000 and your equity at 105,000)

# FINDING DEALS:
* Look at the county's home appraisal value. This will be the county's assessment of the home price.
    * Dallas County : http://www.dallascad.org/SearchAddr.aspx
    * Look at the home owners, tax history. See how much they pay in Taxes and if they have any outstanding tax payments.
    * https://www.dallasact.com/act_webdev/dallas/searchbyproperty.jsp
    * If someone has outstanding payments, they may be more likely to accept a deal lower than the asking price.
* To estimate rent rates in your area:
    * Go to https://www.rentometer.com/
* Look for ~12% Cash on Cash ROI
* Use Rental Property Caluculator on Bigger Pockets
    * https://www.biggerpockets.com/real-estate-investment-calculator
* If offer is rejected, set a reminder to follow up with them x weeks later, to see if they changed their mind.
    * Set a reminder in via biggerpockets calculator
* If property has been on market for a long time, dont give your best deal. Offer less and negotiate.
* If property is a good deal and hot, you may want to not lowball.

* After getting some conventional loans (allowed a maximum of 8-10 conventional loans but sometimes cant get more than 3-5), he got commercial loans from Bank of the West for 2-4 unit properties. This is rare but if you build a relationship they can lend you money on residential properies.
    * Bank of the West gave him 25 year amortization, 10 year terms, and good interest rates
* Does 2-4 units per year
* Buys value-add properties that need 5,000 - 10,000 of work (this is used out of pocket)
    * Keeps existing tenant there, then when they leave, rehab it to raise rents and re-lease
* Get a realtor to create a MLS feed that matches your criteria, this is better than using Zillow, Trulia, etc
    * Find agent with investment background, not a regular agent
* Driving for dollars works
    * Sent 100 letters, got 10 responses
    * Letter containted personized info (like owners name, house picture, and offer in details)
        * Pick a reasonable price, decide how to finance it (Cash is best, but he didnt do this)
        * Skip agents and offer to pay their closing costs
    * Send them a letter every 6 months if no contact
    * Lowball the offer because you cant see the inside and it will require work
* He estimates 10-15% vacancy
* Keeps 5-6 months of expenses for each owned property as a emergency fund per property
* He raises rents because he thinks its a business
* Likes B class areas
* Dont like buildings over 50-60 years old (1950s), prefer newer than that
* Avoid flood zones
* Review monthly reports that property manager will send you
* Keep record of all maintancence, even small things because it may lead to more problems (drain clogs up alot, etc)
* At the end of the year the property manager should do a walk-through inspection to see if everything looks good
* Likes 10-12% cap rate. But when estimating extremely conservative (12% vacancy, 15% repairs, etc), 6-7% works too.
* When analyzing a deal, don't just give estimates.
    * Rent
        * Look at the current lease for the current rate
        * Use craigslist to find similar properties in the area
        * Use rentometer
        * Contact local property managers in the area and ask what the rent should be (send them the address of your property)
    * Vacancy
        * Multifamily will have higher vacancy
        * Dense populations will have less vacancy
    * Property Tax
        * Look it up online
        * Be careful of homestead exemption, which means if the owners family dies, they may get less taxes. So if I buy, my taxes would be different
        * Check if your state re-assesses the property tax after a sale (some states do this)
    * Insurance
        * Usually doesnt cost $1,000/year for a SFH
        * A good rate is about $500/year for a $200k condo
* 3 most important metrics for him are:
    * Cash Flow (looks for $250/unit)
    * Cash on Cash (looks for 15%)
    * Internal Rate of Return (looks for 20-25%)
    * Cap Rate Not as Important~~~ (lookst for 10-12%, or worse if strict estimates)
* Maintanence estimates:
    * A class - $1,200/year
    * B class - $2,400/year (maybe)
* Cap ex estimates (break them down individually):
    * Break down each major appliance:
        * Example: Roof, current age 5, Projected lifespan of 20 years, $4,000 replacement cost
        * Example: HVAC, current age 10, Projected lifespan of 15 years, $2,500 replacement cost
    * Make a schedule based on those estimates and divide their costs by 12 months.
* Buy in primary/secondary cities that have 1,000,000+ population.
    * Basically the largest cities in a state, not smaller ones
* How to calculate IRR (https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/8rdp2j/how_to_calculate_the_internal_rate_of_return_of_a/e0r2brh/)
* Look at flood risk and dont buy flood areas (http://floodtools.com/Home.aspx)
* Doesnt buy properties with structure, electrical, plumbing issues
* Only looks for houses that need paint job, new flooring, new appliances, maybe new kitchen cabinets, maybe bathroom work
* Big fan of Dallas and Houston, it was top 5 list of his market analysis (but couldn't afford the market)
* Other cities on his list were Charlotte & Nashville 
* Had a hard time finding good deals on the MLS.
    * Spent 10 months doing direct mail (sent 100 personal letters to MFH and got 4 to sell)
* Plans on selling his worst performing SFHs in the future
    * Possible opportunity to buy???
* Driving for Dollars:
    * Since it was "as-is" he got financing via commercial loans, since residential loans needed inspections and valuation
        * His lenders didnt care about the condition of the property, only the loan to value ratio (LTV and LTV after rehab)
            * The most important thing lenders try to look at is debt coverage ratio, so sell them on this number.
            * debt coverage ratio (DSCR) is NOI / annual mortgage debt service (principle and interest payments)
    * visited 2 neighborhoods he was interested in with MFH
    * got each address in a spreadsheet
    * looked up each owners tax info,etc 
    * wrote one page letter with intro, offer terms (include "no agent", "no commissions", "as-is condition"), and contact info
        * No agent means no sales commission but only do this is you have a good escrow company and dont mind writing purchase contracts yourself (or hire a lawyer)
        * told them he was serious and gave an introduction about himself
    * attached a picture of the property
    * wrote price of property on fron of letter (big and bold)
    * one accepted his as-is offer
    * one negotiated extra $5k
    * another wouldnt budge until he offered to pay closing costs and property taxes
    * he offered below market price and well below if it was slightly rehabed and rented at market price
    * he assures them that he has financing, funds, team lined up and doesnt try to act too sales-ie
    * if looking at a $200,000 property, he would offer $150,000 - $175,000
    * if worried about issues with the house (not being able to see inside), keep the contengency there so you can potentially back out during escrow and potentially negotiate a lower price.
* always fixes things that are broken like hvac, water heater, holes in walls, etc
    * Doesnt worry about too many cosmetic things that are over the top (nice carpet, stainless steel, etc)
* Look for a nice property with a specific type. Then find what it rents for. See what his current property looks like compared to that property and determine how much rehab it needs to meet the nice properties standards and rent.

    * $3,000 gross rent ($750/unit)

    * Loan payments: 789/month (30% down, 25 year amortization, 5.15% rate)
    * Cash flow: $1,079 ($270/unit)
* In Kansas City, he likes Grandview and Lee's Summit (especially down south)
    * zip code 64110 is ok, but too expensive
    * never buy in 64128 or 64129/64130
    * hyde park is ok if its north/west, closer to 71 is sketchy
* Best way to find good property managers is from referrals, make sure investors say they are good to work with. Don't go with smaller companies, go with bigger ones.
